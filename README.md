### Things that can be improved

- Add I18n library to translate texts, even if we just need english. Becuase in this case later add a language would be easier
- I would like to add Injency dependency and create interfaces to really create a ports and adapters architecture but i was limited on time on this assesment and i thought that was not worth to do it in this case.
- Add a toast once the text is added to the clipboard
- I would change zustand stores to providers scoped in each page that is needed to avoid memory overload.
